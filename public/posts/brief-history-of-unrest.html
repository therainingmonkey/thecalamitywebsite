<h1>A Brief History of Unrest</h1>

<p>The album began in the attic of a haunted house in the Autumn of 2016. I was sitting cross legged on the floor, as is my wont, with an old semi-broken 8 track recorder before me. I pressed record, strummed a bar or two, sang a few words in a hushed voice. The sound faded, the ghosts moaned. I had 7 or 8 songs, which I conceived as a kind of 'day in the life' type mini-album. A sort of indie 'Ulysses', if you will. <em>HIGH CONCEPT ART</em>. </p>

<p>I strummed another chord, possibly a Dm7. 'That,' I said to myself, 'is GENIUS.' The ghosts all agreed with me. None of them had faces, possibly no ears either, so the value of their opinions was questionable. </p>

<p>These early versions of the songs and the accompanying evidence for the existence of ghosts were tragically lost when, in attempting to fix the 8 track, I completely destroyed it. Turns out electronics are quite complicated, something I should have known from the time I mistakenly soldered my own hair in GCSE Systems. </p>

<p>Three years later, or thereabouts, I was hanging from another loose end asking questions such as: 'What should I do with myself?' and 'What is my purpose?'. A career was out of the question, obviously, so I decided to make an album instead. And not just any old album, THE album. </p>

<p>Yes, THE ALBUM, which I had been mulling over the whole time, chopping and changing and rearranging... </p>

<p>At the time, I was the proud possesor of a room in an art studio above a Thai restaurant in town. I borrowed a couple of microphones and set to work. I wrote 'Morning, Morning' and 'Unrest' around this time, which completed the track listing. I recorded street sounds, machine sounds, tape sounds, radio sounds, television sounds, Eric Cantona sounds... </p>

<p>The process was long and winding and road-like. Various fellow travellers joined me for portions of the road, to whom I am immensely grateful. Their company was a considerable improvement on the ghosts, who were somewhat monotonous.</p>

<p>Hopefully it all hangs together, and is not just a disparate collection of songs. I think I have ended up creating a fairly accurate representation of my own psyche, which is basically what I was aiming for. </p>

<p>SO, here we are then, at our destination...</p>
