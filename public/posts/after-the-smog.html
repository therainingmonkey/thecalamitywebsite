<h1>After The Smog: Making People Uncomfortable on Purpose.</h1>

<p>In a dark dark street in a dark dark house in a dark dark attic, there was A DOOR.</p>

<p>This door lay propped against the back wall. Old, stained and sorry for itself. Onto this door, Steph painted The Ghosts - the spirits of the forgotten world.</p>

<p>POST INDUSTRIAL CITY was a tune that Matt S and Steph were chucking about the attic. A long doomy drone on mostly one chord (Dm) which could last several hours. </p>

<p>Let us take you on an odyssey...</p>

<p>AFTER THE SMOG WE ARE ALONE STOP YOU AND ME AND THE MACHINES WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMEBODY ELSE STOP YOU WOULDN'T KNOW THEM STOP</p>

<p>(In writing the words, I eschewed anything too florid, tried to keep it sparse and haunting. Similar with riff.) </p>

<p>The song became the centre piece of what we affectionately named 'The Dread Suite'. George later added a mostly one note keyboard part. There is a video somewhere of us playing it in Brum, with the aforementioned George doggedly holding that note and ocassionally whacking a tambourine when it seemed appropriate. Not sure people really knew what to make of it.</p>

<p>We would often open our sets with DREAD, causing a passing painter to remark one evening that we seemed to make our audience uncomfortable, but this was a good thing. </p>

<p>In conclusion: if you want comfort, buy a sofa*. If not, listen to The Calamity:</p>

<p>*I myself am very fond of both comfort and sofas so not knocking it as a life choice. </p>
