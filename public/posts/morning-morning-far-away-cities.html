<h1>Morning, Morning: Far Away Cities</h1>

<p>You may be thinking that I have written about this song before. WRONG. I have written about the single version before, which is very, VERY different. </p>

<p>This one has a fade out. It has the sound of some vents, roaring up from the Thai restaurant under the studio.</p>

<p>(I recorded them on a dark and stormy night, as I remember, during which I also spilt wine all over the laptop, damaging it irreperably.)</p>

<p>It is also shorter than the single version and has half of the lyrical content, ending on wistful note. I dream of far away cities. Not specific or existing ones, just far away ones.</p>

<p>Let that thought stay with you as you drift away into the sleepy fade out.</p>

<p>Listen to the album version here: </p>

<p>This is the end of 'Side One' in old money, so have yourself a break, get yourself a mug full of gin, and prepare yourself mentally and physically for 'Side Two'.</p>

<p>(Unfortunately The Calamity PLC do not have the money to pay for a vinyl pressing, so if anyone would like to send me thousands of pounds we can make the metaphorical sides A REALITY.*)</p>
