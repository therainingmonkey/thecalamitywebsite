<h1>Satellites: A Denunciation of Nick Robinson (Lizard)</h1>

<p>Now muse, let us sing of space hardware...</p>

<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/itsacalamity/satellites">https://soundcloud.com/itsacalamity/satellites</a></p>

<p>I wrote Satellites in 'the attic period', and it is one of the oldest songs on the album, from 2016. The chord progression is older still - I recycled it from a pre-Calamity song which hadn't seen the light of day since 2013. </p>

<p>The song is about the all-pervasive media age, the social medias, the mass medias... 'like poison dripping down'... Comes from a similar 'fear and dread' type mindset which informed 'I Fell Asleep', a song off The Calamity EP about fears of impending apocalypse. </p>

<p>Trawling through clips of the news to sample for the recording, I came across a clip of Nick Robinson, I think, one of those BBC types. He was talking of 'our desire to communicate, to have instant information, to be connected at all times'.</p>

<p>But DO we desire these things? Do they make us happy? Or is this a representative of a news corporation telling us what we desire (more news, apparently)? Who even is Nick Robinson?</p>

<p>To take these questions in order: its complicated; mostly no; definitely yes; corporate droid.</p>

<p>Plug yourself into the machine kids. It's for your own good.</p>
