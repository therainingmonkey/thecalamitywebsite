<h1>Drifting Through, Sunday Noon: Being and Idleness</h1>

<p>Then a voice on high said: 'Nail your colours and sail into the VAST EMPTINESS'. </p>

<p>You drift through the cosmos for many days, until you find a room suspended in space. It is the box room at the back of an old creaking house, overlooking a garden.</p>

<p>(God does not speak these days, and if he did it would only be a whisper in the waste land, easily drowned. All you hear is the honking of the geese, the roar of the engines.)</p>

<p>Underemployed and tired of the house and the satellites, I went walking. A circuit of the park brought me back to where I began. Roll the rock up the hill again...</p>

<p>I thought about running away to join the merchant navy but wrote a song instead.</p>

<p>This is how that ended up:</p>
