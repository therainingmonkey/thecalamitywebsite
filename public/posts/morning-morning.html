<h1>Morning, Morning</h1>

<p>MORNING, morning everyone...<br>
how are you?<br>
do come in...<br>
take a seat, have a cup of tea.<br></p>

<p>LISTEN TO THIS:</p>

<p>Now, let me tell you of ISOLATION and ALIENATION.</p>

<p>This song was composed in the summer of 2019. ALthough it is 'pre-lockdown', the motifs of empty rooms and plague crosses, as well as the aforementioned isolation and alienation, make this song very 'current'. Clearly I am blessed with second sight.*</p>

<p>The sense of social ostracism (shut away with the madmen) pervades, restricted horizons give rise to a vague sense of longing (far away there's a city...). I find myself looking more towards the past as the present gets uglier. </p>

<p>I went outside today, the sense of liberty was palpable, but incomplete. </p>

<p>*Like Mal in the Midsomer Murders episode 'Second Sight'.</p>
