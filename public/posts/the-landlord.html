<h1>The Landlord: Contemplating An Enclosed Existence</h1>

<p>GOOD AFTERNOON VOID!</p>

<p>How are you this week?</p>

<p>I am John Clare - misfit romantic, self taught peasant - and I come to tell you of the evils of ENCLOSURE.</p>

<p>This song is more about landlord-ism than landlords specifically, though them too. It was partly inspired by an encounter with 'The Even Bigger Man' in a bar in Wolves city centre. He sells land to the Saudis. </p>

<p>Basically, what I'm asking is: <em>where's my common land gone?</em></p>

<p>Two hundred years late mate.  </p>

<p>(There were fully automated luxury communists sketching out schemes for world revolution on the late night ket sesh. It all boiled down to very little of consequence.)</p>

<p>The guitar solo in this song is off-key. Like a jagged bit of concrete. Matt S wrote it, or was moved by the power of the spirit to hammer it into existence. I have since resisted any attempt to alter it. </p>

<p>Contemplating my current enclosed existence, I have concluded that governments today are pretty much the same as 18th century land barons. </p>

<p>STAY AT HOME. TALK TO THE VOID. CONSUME CONTENT.</p>
