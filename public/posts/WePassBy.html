<h1>We Pass By: Background Noise</h1>

<p>The devil will find work for idle hands to do…</p>

<p>I have spent the last few months suffering from a chronic case of employment. Now I am at a loose end and recalled that I have posted nothing on the blog since my seminal rundown of all the songs on Now That’s What I Call Christmas.</p>

<p>We have a new single out, as you may have noticed. ‘We Pass By’ charts the ups and downs of existence in the post industrial town, the squalor and malaise, information age white noise. We go out, we come home, arm in arm. The man next door is working on car engine in the backyard at 9 in the morning outside our window, so we’re up bright and early.</p>

<p>That house was haunted. There were noises in the night which would keep me awake, and I had strange lucid dreams about faceless people appearing in the doorway when I was sleeping in the room with all the mould in. Definitely ghosts. I wrote the tune for ‘We Pass By’ in the mould room. It is a simple and circular tune, much like a wheel which has not been reinvented. I was sat on George’s bed (our sometime keyboardist) playing some songs of an evening, shaking off the last remnants of a hangover.</p>

<p>We don’t live in there any more. Aside from the (possibly mould related) hauntedness, it was an excellent house. Very roomy, but also cheap. We had a dining room, a living room, a snooker room/library and, after the departure of Calamity 'manager' Casper Drake for Spain, a music room in the attic. It was up there that such classics as ‘After The Smog’ and ‘Rag and Bone’ were birthed, and where early demos of ‘I Fell Asleep’ and ‘Lifestyle Express’ were recorded on an old eight track which I subsequently broke by pressing the record button too hard.</p>

<p>The hauntings began to happen as the house became emptier, when it was only three of us occupying two of four bedrooms. There were darker spaces for the ghosts to hide in, and we left them to the big room at the front with all the mould, returned to the box room. I was only scraping by. But we went out on Friday nights, Saturday nights, arm in arm, we had good times.</p>

<p>Then we woke up one morning to find a ‘For Sale’ sign stuck up out the front. And though the landlord kept having second thoughts saying ‘nah I want you to stay, I’ll take it off the market next week’, he never did, sold it, and turfed us out. They’ve carved it up into some awful six-bed rent-by-the-room house share. No more snooker room/library, no more dancing in the living room.</p>

<p>I’ve decided that the single will be accompanied by a live version of ‘The Landlord’ as a B-side.</p>

<p>When I wrote this song, it was only Steph and I left in the band, and it looked like it was all going to fizzle out. But Matt joined that winter and we’ve kept going, through rain and shine, and are now possibly more functional than ever before, We have a new drummer (Mitch), and a place to practice in town. You can hang out the window of an evening and watch all the people pass by.</p>

<p>We hope that you enjoy the single as much as we enjoyed arguing about whether Matt’s guitar part is too ‘chiming’ (I think it’s fine). Stay tuned for a video which will happen just as soon as we can overcome our general inertia and organisational ineptitude.</p>

<p>Au revoir,</p>

<p>Billy</p>

<p>PS. Favourite Smiths song? Today, it is either ‘The Boy With The Thorn In His Side’ or ‘You Just Haven’t Earned It Yet, Baby’.</p>
