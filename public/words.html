<h2><a href="./posts/five-minutes-full-of-light.html"> Five Minutes Full of Light - A Punch of Jaunt</a></h2>

<p>Upon listening to the album, erstwhile guitarist Matt S wrote in to Calamity HQ. In a five star review, he described the album as 'very, very good' and 'a weird mix of incredibly dense morbidity and an almost uncomfortable punch of jaunt'.</p>

<h2><a href="./posts/rag-and-bone-v2.html"> Rag and Bone (ver. 2) - How My Artistry Is Criminally Underappreciated.</a></h2>

<p>When I showed a demo of this to Matt P (producer, dreamweaver, visionary), his initial reaction was: WHY??? Rag and Bone the first (see Calamity EP) did not need a Rag and Bone the Second. </p>

<p>I listened carefully to all advice and then ignored it, as is my...</p>

<p>You may be thinking that I have written about this song before. WRONG. I have written about the single version before, which is very, VERY different. </p>

<p>This one has a fade out. It has the sound of some vents, roaring up from the Thai restaurant under the ...</p>

<p>Then a voice on high said: 'Nail your colours and sail into the VAST EMPTINESS'. </p>

<p>You drift through the cosmos for many days, until you find a room suspended in space. It is the box room at the back of an old creaking house, overlooking a garden.</p>

<p>In a dark dark street in a dark dark house in a dark dark attic, there was A DOOR.</p>

<p>This door lay propped against the back wall. Old, stained and sorry for itself. Onto this door, Steph painted The Ghosts - the spirits of the forgotten world.</p>

<p>Picture, if you will, a sunny afternoon in July. </p>

<p>I had a tune knocking round my head. Sounded sort of folky as I strummed out the chords. Mother earth's washed out ethereal son. Write some lyrics about faery lands forlorn or somesuch...</p>

<p>GOOD AFTERNOON VOID!</p>

<p>How are you this week?</p>

<p>I am John Clare - misfit romantic, self taught peasant - and I come to tell you of the evils of ENCLOSURE.</p>

<p>This song is more about landlord-ism than landlords specifically, though them too. It was partly insp...</p>

<p>I wrote Satellites in 'the attic period', and it is one of the oldest songs on the album, from 2016. The chord pr...</p>

<h2><a href="./posts/brief-history-of-unrest.html"> A Brief History of Unrest</a></h2>

<p>The album began in the attic of a haunted house in the Autumn of 2016. I was sitting cross legged on the floor, as is my wont, with an old semi-broken 8 track recorder before me. I pressed record, strummed a bar or two, sang a few words in a hushed voice....</p>
